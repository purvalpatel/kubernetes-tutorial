### Where Blue-Green is BEST
✅ Critical production systems <br>
✅ Releases with DB-safe changes <br>
✅ When you want fast rollback <br>

### ❌ Not great for:
- Large DB schema breaking changes
- Long-running background jobs

### Kubernetes deplpoyment:
- Blue Deployment : `Label : blue`
- Green Deployment: `Label : green`
- Service : `version : blue` (Traffic switch key)
Just change the version : green to switch <br>

For rollback chnage key in service, `version: blue`
